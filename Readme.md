# Usage

<a name="installer"></a>
## Installer

Download the newest installer from the [release section](https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings/releases) and execute it.

If you have an older standalone version installed, the installer will automatically uninstall the old version and install the new version.

<a name="standalone"></a>
## Standalone

Download the newest standalone archive from the [release section](https://github.com/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings/releases) and unpack the archive.

To install for the first time simply start AdvancedSettings.exe once while SteamVR is running. It will register with SteamVR and automatically starts whenever SteamVR starts (Can be disabled in the settings).

To upgrade an existing installation first stop SteamVR and delete the old application folder (or override it). Then start SteamVR and run AdvancedSettings.exe once.

<a name="command_line_arguments"></a>
## Command Line Arguments

The application (`AdvancedSettings.exe`) can be run with the following optional arguments:

`"--desktop-mode"`: Creates a settings window on the desktop, but not in VR. Running `startdesktopmode.bat` in the install directory has the same effect.

`"--force-no-sound"`: Forces sound effects off.

`"--force-no-manifest"`: Forces not using a `.vrmanifest`.

`"--force-install-manifest"`: Force installs the `.vrmanifest` and adds the application to autostart. If you're having issues with autostart not working try running the program once with this set. The program will exit early when this flag is set.

`"--force-remove-manifest"`: Force uninstalls the `.vrmanifest`. This should be done every time the application is uninstalled. On Windows it is automatically done by the uninstaller. The program will exit early when this flag is set.

<a name="preview_builds"></a>
## Preview builds

If you want to try latest and greatest unreleased features, you can download the latest from the CI (Continuous Integration) server for [Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/icewind1991/openvr-advancedsettings/branch/master). The Linux CI does not provide binary artifacts.

These version are not stable and this should be considered for advanced users only.

## Top Page:

![Root Page](docs/screenshots/RootPage.png)

- **Supersampling Profile**: Allows to apply supersampling profiles. Profiles can be created on the SteamVR page
- **Chaperone Profile**: Allows to apply chaperone profiles. Profiles can be created on the Chaperone page
- **Microphone**: Allows to set the microphone volume and to mute/unmute it.
- **Push-to-Talk**: Enable/disable push-to-talk.

<a name="steamvr_page"></a>
## - SteamVR Page:

![SteamVR Page](docs/screenshots/SteamVRPage.png)

- **Profile**: Allows to apply/define/delete supersampling profiles that save supersampling and reprojection settings.
- **Application Supersampling**: Supersampling setting for OpenVR applications/games. Application supersampling [now behaves linearly](https://steamcommunity.com/games/250820/announcements/detail/1256913672017664045) where 2.0 means twice the number of pixel.
  - **Note**: Manual Supersampling Override be checked.
- **Enable Manual Supersampling Override**: Enables user control of Supersampling, instead of SteamVR auto profiles.
- **Enable Motion Smoothing**: Enables Motion Smoothing, and disables asynchronous reprojection.
- **Restart SteamVR**: Restart SteamVR (May crash the Steam overlay when SteamVR Home is running when you restart. Therefore I advice that you close SteamVR Home before restarting).

<a name="chaperone_page"></a>
## - Chaperone Page:

![Chaperone Page](docs/screenshots/ChaperonePage.png)

- **Profile**: Allows to apply/define/delete chaperone profiles that save geometry info, style info or other chaperone settings (What exactly is saved in a chaperone profile can be selected when a profile is created).
- **Visibility**: Allows to configure the visibility of the chaperone bounds. 50% to 100% opacity.
- **Fade Distance**: Allows to configure the distance at which the chaperone bounds are shown. When set to 0 chaperone bounds are completely invisible.
- **Height**: Allows to configure the height of the chaperone bounds.
- **Center Marker**: Displays a marker that represents the center of the playspace.
- **Play Space Maker**: Displays the outlines of the rectangle representing the playspace.
- **Force Bounds**: Force chaperone bounds always on.
- **Disable Chaperone**: Disables Chaperone by setting fade distance to 0.0.
- **Proximity Warning Settings**: Opens a page that allows to configure several warning methods for when the user comes too close to the chaperone bounds.
- **Flip Orientation**: Flips the orientation of the play space.
- **Reload from Disk**: Reloads the chaperone bounds geometry from disk.

<a name="chaperone_proximity_page"></a>
## - Chaperone Proximity Warning Settings Page:

![Chaperone Proximity Warning Settings Page](docs/screenshots/ChaperoneWarningPage.png)

- **Switch to Beginner Mode**: Switches the chaperone bound's style to beginner mode when the user's distance to the chaperone falls below the configured activation distance.
- **Trigger Haptic Feedback**: The left and right controller start vibrating when the user's distance to the chaperone falls below the configured activation distance. (HMD or controllers can trigger)
- **Audio Warning**: Plays an alarm sound when the user's distance to the chaperone falls below the configured activation distance.
  - **Loop Audio**: Whether the audio alarm should only be played once or in a loop.
  - **Loop Audio**: Modify audio volume as a function of the user's distance to the chaperone.
- **Open dashboard**: Opens the dashboard when the user's distance to the chaperone falls below the configured activation distance. The idea is to pause the game (most single-player games auto-pause when the dashboard is shown) to give the user time for reorientation.
- **Velocity Dependent Fade/Activation Distance**: Dynamically modifies the chaperone's fade distance and the proximity warning's activation distance as a function of the player's speed. The used formula is: *distance = old_distance * ( 1 + distance_modifier * max(left_controller_speed, right_controller_speed, hmd_speed) )*

<a name="space_offset_page"></a>
## - Space Offset Page:

![Play Space Page](docs/screenshots/OffsetPage.png)

Allows to temporarily move and rotate the center of the playspace. This allows to reach interaction elements that are just inside our real-world walls or otherwise inaccessible (e.g. when your playspace is smaller than the recommended one). Can also be used to discover the terrors that lie outside of the intended playspace (ever wondered what's behind the door in The Lab?).

- **Adjust Chaperone**: When enabled then the chaperone bounds stay in place when the playspace is moved or rotated (so noone gets hurt). Depending on chaperone mode this may or may not adjust with height.

<a name="space_fix_page"></a>
## - Space Fix Page:

![Playspace Fix Page](docs/screenshots/FloorFixPage.png)


- **Fix Floor** Allows you to fix the height of your floor. Just place one controller on your floor and press the button.
- **Recenter Playspace** Besides fixing the floor height, also recenters the place space around the controller on the floor.

  - **NOTE**: The Push-to-talk box must be enabled for this feature to work.
- **Audio Profile**: Allows you to apply/define/delete audio profiles that save playback devices, mute state, and volume.


<a name="utilities_page"></a>
## - Utilities Page:

![Utilities Page](docs/screenshots/UtilitiesPage.png)

- **Keyboard Utilities:** Some applications (mostly 2D-monitor applications with tackled-on/modded-in VR support) do not support the VR keyboard but require an actual physical keyboard for text input. This utilities allow to send emulated key strokes from VR keyboard input to such application to overcome this limitation. Does not work in desktop mode.

- **Alarm Clock:** Just a simple alarm clock so you don't miss important appointments. VR can sure mess up perception of time. Does not work in desktop mode.

- **Steam Desktop Overlay Width:** Allows to increase the size of the Steam desktop overlay. Useful for multi-monitor setups. It is saved between sessions.

- **Media Control Keys:** Allows controlling a media player through the media keys. This is the same as having a keyboard with media keys and then pressing them. Should support most common media players.

# Notes:

- The center marker and the play space marker are provided by the chaperone subsystem, and therefore they will have the same color and visibility settings as the chaperone bounds.

- Application autostart can also be configured in the SteamVR menu (SteamVR->Settings->Applications->"Advanced Settings").

- You can modify the shutdown wait time when restarting SteamVR by opening restartvrserver.bat and changing the number behind "timeout /t" (unit is seconds).
