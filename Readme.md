## Command Line Arguments

The application (`AdvancedSettings.exe`) can be run with the following optional arguments:

`"--desktop-mode"`: Creates a settings window on the desktop, but not in VR. Running `startdesktopmode.bat` in the install directory has the same effect.

`"--force-no-sound"`: Forces sound effects off.

`"--force-no-manifest"`: Forces not using a `.vrmanifest`.

`"--force-install-manifest"`: Force installs the `.vrmanifest` and adds the application to autostart. If you're having issues with autostart not working try running the program once with this set. The program will exit early when this flag is set.

`"--force-remove-manifest"`: Force uninstalls the `.vrmanifest`. This should be done every time the application is uninstalled. On Windows it is automatically done by the uninstaller. The program will exit early when this flag is set.

`"--reset-steamvr-settings"`: Resets the SteamVR settings we adjust to Steam's Default Values.

## INI File Options

There are some features that can only be enabled by directly specifying them in the .ini file. On windows the .ini file can be found at `Users\username\AppData\Roaming\AdvancedSettings-Team\OpenVRAdvancedSettings.ini`.

When adding options to the .ini file, they must be added under the correct section to function.

Currently the following ini-file-only settings exist:

Under `[playspaceSettings]` adding `showLogMatricesButton=true` will enable a button in the Offsets Tab that when pressed will write a section to the log file containing the current pose matrix data for tracked devices and universe settings.

Also under `[playspaceSettings]` adding `simpleRecenter=true` will disable a workaround that allows seated recenter to function on non-lighthouse devices. The workaround instantly applies a second seated recenter whenever a seated recenter is executed. Because simpleRecenter=true will break non-lighthouse seated mode, and true/false behavior is indistinguishable on lighthouse devices, usage of simpleRecenter=true is not recommended.

Under `[utilitiesSettings]` adding `vrcDebug=true` will enable some buttons in the Utilities Tab to toggle debug panels in VRChat.

Under `[applicationSettings]` adding `enableDebug=true` will show a "Debug State" text box in the Settings Tab. Changing the debug state number may be used for in-dev branch builds. At this time, it doesn't do anything on the master build.

## Preview builds

If you want to try latest and greatest unreleased features, you can download the latest from the CI (Continuous Integration) server for [Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/OVRAdvancedSettings/openvr-advancedsettings/branch/master)and [Linux](https://circleci.com/gh/OpenVR-Advanced-Settings/OpenVR-AdvancedSettings) (`gcc` build, CircleCI issue requires login to see artifact tab).

These version are not stable and this should be considered for advanced users only.

## Un-Installing

### Windows

- Automatically
  - Run the un-installer, It should be wherever you isntalled OVRAS
- Semi-Manually
  - Run AdvancedSettings.exe with the command --force-remove-manifest
  - delete install directory
  - (optional) delete logs and settings `%appdata%/AdvancedSettings-Team` (`C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\AdvancedSettings-Team`)
- Manually
	- go to steam install/config directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\config by default)
    - edit the appconfig.json to remove the path pointed to Advanced Settings (`C:\\Program Files\\OpenVR-AdvancedSettings\\manifest.vrmanifest` by default)
    - delete install folder, settings and log files manually

## - Chaperone Proximity Warning Settings Page

<img src="docs/screenshots/ChaperoneWarningPage.png" width="600" alt="Chaperone Proximity Warning Settings Page">

- **Switch to Beginner Mode**: Switches the chaperone bound's style to beginner mode when the user's distance to the chaperone falls below the configured activation distance.
- **Trigger Haptic Feedback**: The left and right controller start vibrating when the user's distance to the chaperone falls below the configured activation distance. (HMD or controllers can trigger)
- **Audio Warning**: Plays an alarm sound when the user's distance to the chaperone falls below the configured activation distance.
  - **Loop Audio**: Whether the audio alarm should only be played once or in a loop.
  - **Loop Audio**: Modify audio volume as a function of the user's distance to the chaperone.
- **Open dashboard**: Opens the dashboard when the user's distance to the chaperone falls below the configured activation distance. The idea is to pause the game (most single-player games auto-pause when the dashboard is shown) to give the user time for reorientation.

## - Space Offset Page

<img src="docs/screenshots/OffsetPage.png" width="600" alt="Space Offsets Page">

Allows users to temporarily move and rotate the center of the playspace. This allows reaching interaction elements that are just outside our real-world walls or otherwise inaccessible (e.g. when your playspace is smaller than the recommended one). Can also be used to discover the terrors that lie outside of the intended playspace (ever wondered what's behind the door in The Lab?).

- **Adjust Chaperone**: When enabled, the chaperone bounds stay accurate even when the playspace is moved or rotated (so noone gets hurt). Depending on chaperone mode this may or may not adjust with height.
- **Seated Recenter**: When clicked, applies the current location and angle of the headset to the offsets such that the user is brought to a centered position. Also applies the current headset height to the default seated height (not visible in offsets). This action will also be activated automatically when a seated application sends a reset center command. *Note: This button is only visible when running seated applications.*

## - Motion Page

<img src="docs/screenshots/MotionPage.png" width="600" alt="Motion Page">

- **Space Drag**: Allows shifting your playspace by dragging your controller, Binds must be set via SteamVR Input system.
  - **Left/Right Hand**: Toggles functionality (must be active in addition to binding via input system to work.)
  - **Comfort Mode**: Limits the rate at which your movement updates, reducing smoothness so that perceived motion starts to feel more like mini-teleports. Higher values reduce smoothness more.
  - **Force Bounds**: Forces the display of the chaperone bounds during Space Drag.
- **Height Toggle**: Toggle between zero and an offset for gravity floor height. If gravity is inactive the user is also moved to this offset. (Example: allows for quick switching between a seated and standing height.) Can be bound via SteamVr Input System.
  - **On**: Current toggle state, Binds directly modify this.
  - **Height Offset**: The amount of the offset (+ is down.)
  - **Set From Y-Offset**: grabs the Y-Offset value from Offset Page.
- **Gravity Settings**: Provides a gravity and momentum simulation to dynamically move your space offset.
  - **On**: Current toggle state, Binds directly modify this.
  - **Gravity Strength**: Gravity simulation's downward acceleration in meters per second squared. Planet buttons provide quick settings for well known gravity strengths. Values can also be typed in directly.
  - **Friction**: Slows down motion over time.
  - **Save Momentum**: whether your momentum is saved between on/off toggles of gravity.
  - **fling Strength**: adjusts the strength at which you "throw" yourself with space drag feature.


## - Rotation Page

<img src="docs/screenshots/RotationPage.png" width="600" alt="Rotation Page">

- **Auto Turn**: Automatically rotates your playspace when you get near a wall, by rotating the direction you're looking to be inside your playspace, parallel to a wall.
  - **Toggle On/Off**: current state, bind directly modifies this.
  - **Activation Distance**: How far from the wall before Autoturn activates.
  - **DeActivation Distance**:  The minimum distance (activation + deactivation) you must be from the wall before autoturn will activate again.
  - **Use Corner Angle**: When already against a wall and reaching a corner, turn the angle of that corner rather than the angle of your headset to the wall (reccomended)
  - **Use Smooth Turn**: Toggles between a smooth turn and a snap turn.
  - **Turn Speed**: How fast you rotate in Degrees per second. Use more for a more comfortable experience, less for natural movement in social/physical VR games.
  - **Detangle Angle**: Settings attempting to keep your cord untangled while using the Auto-Turn feature.
    - **Min Rotations(deg)**: The amount of rotation before Auto-Turn starts to try and un-tangle your cord.
    - **Max Wall Angle(deg)**: When the angle of your headset to the wall is less than Max Wall Angle, it will turn you whichever way will start to untangle your cord. Otherwise it will turn you whichever way is closest. Set to '0' if you have a cordless setup 
- **Redirected Walking**: Adds rotation as you walk to turn you away from the nearest wall you're moving towards. At 'Imperceptable' and 'Slight' angles should be subtle enough to feel as if you're walking in a straight line, effectively making your playspace feel bigger. 
  - **On**: Toggles Feature on/off
  - **Radius**: Radius in meters of how big a circle would be drawn to keep you walking in a straight line inside a game.


- **Space Turn**: Allows rotating your playspace by rotating your controller. Binds must be set via SteamVR Input system.
  - **Left/Right Hand**: Toggles functionality (must be active in addition to binding via input system to work.)
  - **Comfort Mode**: Limits the rate at which your rotation updates, reducing smoothness so that perceived rotation starts to feel more like mini-snap-turns. Higher values reduce smoothness more.
  - **Force Bounds**: Forces the display of the chaperone bounds during Space Turn.
- **Snap Turn Angle**: Allows snap (instant) turning by the specified angle. Can type in values or use the preset buttons for angles that neatly divide 360 degrees. Must bind actions via SteamVR Input interface.
- **Smooth Turn Rate**: Allows smooth turning by a percentage of a degree per frame. (i.e. 100% at 90fps is 90 degress/sec or 15 RPM)


## - Space Fix Page

<img src="docs/screenshots/FloorFixPage.png" width="600" alt="Space Fix Page">

- **Fix Floor** Allows you to fix the height of your floor. Just place one controller on your floor and press the button.
- **Recenter Playspace** Besides fixing the floor height, also recenters the place space around the controller on the floor.
- **Apply Space Settings Offsets as Center** Takes current values from Offsets page and re-caliberates center/rotation. **Caution** The reset function will then refer to this location as the new zero location, overriding the old zero location.
- **Revert All Changes from This Session** Reverts the chaperone config back to the state it was in when launching vr. (This applies the Autosaved Profile from the Chaperone Tab).
  
## - Audio Page

- **Keyboard Utilities:** Some applications (mostly 2D-monitor applications with tackled-on/modded-in VR support) do not support the VR keyboard but require an actual physical keyboard for text input. This utilities allow to send emulated key strokes from VR keyboard input to such application to overcome this limitation. Does not work in desktop mode. Adding vrcDebug=true to [utilitiesSettings] in the OpenVRAdvancedSettings.ini will display some buttons for VRChat debug overlay keybinds. The "Keyboard Input" button works as described [here](docs/specs/Keyboard_Manager-Parser_Spec.md).

- **Alarm Clock:** Just a simple alarm clock so you don't miss important appointments. VR can sure mess up perception of time. Does not work in desktop mode.

- **Media Control Keys:** Allows controlling a media player through the media keys. This is the same as having a keyboard with media keys and then pressing them. Should support most common media players.

## - Statistics Page

<img src="docs/screenshots/StatisticsPage.png" width="600" alt="Statistics Page">

- **HMD Distance Moved**: Shows the distance the headset has moved on the xz-plane.
- **HMD Rotations**: Shows the number of rotations around the y-axis (Useful for untangling the cord).
- **Left Controller Max Speed**: Shows the max speed of the left controller.
- **Right Controller Max Speed**: Shows the max speed of the right controller.
- **Presented Frames**: Number of frames presented to the hmd in the currently running application.
- **Dropped Frames**: Number of frames dropped in the currently running application.
- **Reprojected Frames**: Number of frames reprojected in the currently running application.
- **Timed Out**: Number of times the currently running application timed out.
- **Reprojection Ratio**: Ratio of presented frames to reprojected frames.

## - Settings Page

<img src="docs/screenshots/SettingsPage.png" width="600" alt="Settings Page">

- **Autostart:** Allows you to enable/disable auto start.
- **Allow External App Chaperone Edits:** Incorporates changes to the chaperone and universe center made by other applications. These changes could come from anywhere, including apps with unpredictable interactions with Advanced Settings. Therefore, this option opens the potential for chaperone misalignment or corruption. However it also allows other chaperone tweaking tools to function in tandem with Advanced Settings. **This option should only be checked if required for compatibility with other apps.** *Note: Changes will only take effect when offsets and rotation are all zero.*
- **Old-Style Motion:** Uses the old system of writing the chaperone universe center and bounds to disk every frame. Use this option only if you experience issues with playspace motion such as snapping back to reset position after releasing a space-drag. This old mode is smooth on most systems but is in theory less performant than the normal method.
- **Universe-Centered Rotation:** Causes Rotation to be applied to Universe Center Rather than HMD (Disables offsets automatically compensating to pivot at the HMD).
- **Enable Motion Features When in Seated Mode:** Uncheck this if Advanced Settings causes strange positioning in a seated application. (Different apps handle seated mode in different ways, some are less compatible with Advanced Settings). Note: if unchecked, all Space Offsets and Motion tab features will be disabled.
- **Disable Automatic Crash Recovery of Chaperone Config:** This prevents applying of the last good autosaved chaperone profile when starting up after not shutting down properly.
- **Disable Notification of Newer Version Availability**: This turns off the on start-up check for a new version. (You can refresh this to do a manual check.)
- **Force Use SteamVR Chaperone**: This feature is currently experimental, when using third party headsets this will allow you to use SteamVR's chaperone, as if it was a native headset.
- **Force Use SteamVR (Disable Oculus API)**: This feature is currently experimental, it should disable Oculus API preventing games with both SteamVR and Oculus API to only run as SteamVR
- ** Exclusive Input Toggle: This feature Enables Exclusive Input Mode, while in this mode you will only send OVRAS keybinds or App keybinds [with the exception of OVRAS system keybinds always working]
- **Disable App Vsync:** Allows setting a custom base update rate for Advanced Settings. (Might be useful on HMDs with very high or very low refresh rates).
- **Shutdown OVRAS** Shuts-Down Advanced Settings without closing out of VR.

# How to Compile

## Building on Windows

Full build instructions can be found [here](docs/building_for_windows.md).

## Building on Linux

Full build instructions can be found [here](docs/building_for_linux.md).

# Notes:

- The center marker and the play space marker are provided by the chaperone subsystem, and therefore they will have the same color and visibility settings as the chaperone bounds.

- Application autostart can also be configured in the SteamVR menu (SteamVR->Settings->Applications->"Advanced Settings").

- You can modify the shutdown wait time when restarting SteamVR by opening restartvrserver.bat and changing the number behind "timeout /t" (unit is seconds).

- When Using Proximity Sensor Features while the Dashboard is up the action will not evaluate, so your mic will be muted, and some chaperone warnings won't work while dashboard is up.

# Common Issues:


- **Issue:** Upon clicking ADV-Settings icon no page shows up.
  - **Cause:** related to multiple GPU systems Displaying OpenGL on low power GPU first (IGPU's primarily) [some programs such as alvr may also cause this issue] 
  - **Solution for Nvidia GPU's:** go to Nvidia Control Panel -> manage 3D settings -> Program Settings -> add Advanced Settings, and change `OpenGL Rendering GPU` to the GPU your VR is connected to.
  - **Solution for Windows (1803+):** go to Settings -> System -> Display -> Select `Classic App` and Browse for `AdvancedSettings.exe` -> Click Options -> Select High Performance

- **Issue:** Snap back when using motion controls with WMR headset
  - **Cause:** WMR boundary off, or set up for standing only.
  - **Solution:** Please set-up WMR for all experiences, and then if you don't want WMR boundary you can toggle off the boundary **after** SteamVR/OpenVR has been started.

- **Issue:** While using Trackers (additional devices besides controllers) Keybinds don't work.
  - **Cause:** Trackers can Assume controller roles, and prevent your controllers from working properly.
  - **Solution:** Assign Tracker Roles Via SteamVR Widget to anything besides `held-in-hand`
  
- **Issue:** Custom Key Presses Not Saving In file.
  - **Cause:** Key Presses Modified while Advanced Settings is running.
  - **Solution:** Only modify the settings file while VR/Advanced Settings is **not** running.
